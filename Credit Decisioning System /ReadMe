## Overview
This project simulates a real‑world credit decision engine. It combines **financial domain knowledge** (debt‑to‑income ratios, household composition) with **supervised machine learning** to predict loan default risk. The system integrates:

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis with visualisations  
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, etc.)  
- A **business rule engine** for hard reject/approve decisions  
- A **risk scoring module** that outputs a 0–100 risk score  
- An **interactive widget** to test custom loan applications  

---

## Features
- **Automated data cleaning** – handles missing values, standardises formats.  
- **Financial ratio calculations** – DTI, PTI, income per person, loan‑to‑income, etc.  
- **Household‑level analysis** – number of earners, dependents, co‑applicant impact.  
- **Machine learning pipeline** – preprocesses categorical/numerical features, trains and evaluates 6 classifiers.  
- **Model persistence** – saves the best model and metadata with `joblib`.  
- **Rule‑based pre‑screening** – fast‑track, automatic rejection for clear violations.  
- **Risk scoring** – composite score based on credit history, DTI, PTI, income, and ML confidence.  
- **Interactive Jupyter widgets** – test your own loan application instantly.  
- **Performance dashboard** – ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature importance, business impact analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** 3.9+  
- **pandas**, **numpy** – data manipulation  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **plotly** – static & interactive visualisations  
- **scikit‑learn** – ML models, preprocessing, metrics  
- **xgboost** – gradient boosting  
- **ipywidgets** – interactive UI  
- **joblib** – model serialisation

## Dataset
The dataset `aussieBank.csv` contains **610 loan applications** with 13 original features, including:

- `Applicant_Income`, `Coapplicant_Income`
- `Amount_Requested`, `Term`
- `Credit_History` (0/1)
- `Number_of_Dependents`
- Categorical: `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `Education_Level`, `Location`
- Target: `Approval_Status` (Y/N)

After feature engineering, **25+ derived features** are created (total income, DTI, PTI, household size, risk flags, etc.).
